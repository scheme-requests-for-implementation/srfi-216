<h2 id="status">Status</h2>

<p>??? the draft/final/withdrawn status of the SRFI, information on how
to subscribe to its mailing list, and important dates in its history.
The editor will add this section.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>
   This SRFI follows on the
    <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-203/">
     SRFI-203
    </a>
   in providing and "out-of-the-box" support for hosting the exercises suggested by the
    <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">
     Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
    </a>
   in portable Scheme.
</p>

<p>
Whereas SRFI-203 focused on the necessarily unportable aspects of the problem set (the graphics), this SRFI aims to provide support for the rest of the features, that are fare more widespread, often already provided, and in reality mostly need just a common vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI provides subroutines for working with time data, multi-threading, streams and SICP names for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
None of these subroutines are fit for production use, and are only designed for pedagogical purposes.
</p>

<p>
 Students, however, are expected to be able to just write
 <pre>
 (include (srfi sicp))
 </pre>
and have the code from the book run without problems (apart from those intended by the book authors).
</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<ol>
<li>Tests for <code> (test-and-set! cell)
</code> test the behaviour, but do not test atomicity.
Suggestions welcome.</li>
<li>I am not very sure whether I should just include all of the SRFI-203 text into this SRFI verbatim, because on one hand, it would be nice to import just a single library to support everything, and on the other hand, the work on implementing these two SRFIs would differ drastically.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>


<p>
<cite>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)</cite>
, by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman, is one of the world's most famous programming textbooks.
The code examples in the book are given in Scheme, and the exercises are mostly expected to be done in Scheme.
The examples and exercises are best executed with a Scheme system that implements a reasonable subset of the Scheme language.
Furthermore, the textbook assumes the existence of several primitives not included in any of the Scheme reports.
Most of these primitives are already either covered by other relevant SRFIs, or can be implemented on top of those.

This SRFI aims at doing precisely this.
The sample implementation uses the features provided by SRFIs 18 and 27, as well as several features provided by the R7RS report, in order to implement the subroutines that SICP code examples assume to exist.

The picture language of Section 2.2.4 is out of scope for this SRFI.
Users are encouraged to refer to the SRFI-203, or any SRFI that supersedes it for the missing subroutines.

This SRFI, combined with SRFI-203, can be compared to SRFI 96, which is to SLIB as these SRFIs are to the SICP. SRFI 96 makes no attempt to document SLIB (which has over 200 modules), much less to extend it. Instead, it documents the constants, variables, procedures, and syntax forms that a Scheme must provide in order to fully host SLIB, which amount to less than forty. 
</p>

<p>
This SRFI provides three constants, five procedures, and one syntactic construction.
</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>??? detailed specification.  This should be detailed enough that a
conforming implementation could be completely created from this
description.</p>

<h3>Booleans.</h3>
<DL>
<DT><U>Constant:</U> <code>false</code></DT>
<DD>
<p>
 Must have a value that would make the <code>if</code> construct choose the second path. On systems that provide <code>#f</code> as a distinct value, it must be <code>#f</code>.
</p>
<p>
 Even though Scheme reports as early as R4RS (Sections 3.2, 6.1) already have <code>#f</code> as a distinct false value, SICP continues to refer to <code>false</code>, see Section 1.1.6, footnote 17.
</p>
</DD>

<DT><U>Constant:</U> <code>true</code></DT>
<DD>
<p>
Must have a value that would make the <code>if</code> construct choose the first path. On systems that provide <code>#t</code> as a distinct value, it must be <code>#t</code>.
</p>
<p>
Even though Scheme reports as early as R4RS (Sections 3.2, 6.1) already have <code>#t</code> as a distinct true value, SICP continues to refer to <code>true</code>, see Section 1.1.6, footnote 17.
</p>
</DD>
</DL>

<h3>Time data.</h3>

<dl>
<dt><u>Procedure:</u><code>(runtime)</code></dt>
<dd>

Returns an integer that specifies the amount of time the system has been running (measured, for example, in microseconds).

The sample implementation measures the running time in microseconds.

See Section 1.2.6 of the SICP, Subsection "Probabilistic Methods", Exercise 1.22.
<br>
<u>Example:</u><br>
<pre>
(runtime)
;; prints 1604464095599.357
</pre>
<br>
<u>Remark:</u> it is not clear, which "system" was running, and in fact, the absolute value returned by this subroutine is never used by itself. The author of this SRFI, therefore opted into assuming that the "system" is the UNIX(tm) operating system, and it "has been running" since the Epoch, Midnight on January 1, 1970 TAI.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Random numbers.</h3>

<dl>
<dt><u>Procedure:</u><code>(random x)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
returns a nonnegative integer less than its integer input.

See Section 1.2.6 of the SICP, Subsection "Fermat Test".
<br>
<u>Example:</u><br>
<pre>
(random 11)
;; prints 1
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

The sample implementation uses <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-27/">SRFI-27</a>.

<h3>Multi-threading.</h3>

<dl>
<dt><u>Procedure:</u><code>
(parallel-execute p1 p2 ...)
</code>
<dd>
Each <math>p_i</math> must be a procedure of no arguments. parallel-execute creates a separate process for each <math>p_i</math>, which applies <math>p_i</math> (to no arguments).
These processes all run concurrently.
<br>
See SICP Section 3.4.2, Subsection "Serializers in Scheme".
<br>
<u>Example:</u>
<pre>
(define x 10)
(parallel-execute
  (lambda () (set! x (* x x))) ; P1
  (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))) ; P2
;; May assign x to any of the following:
;; 101 - P1 sets x to 100 and then P2 increments x to 101.
;; 121 - P2 increments x to 11 and then P1 sets x to x * x .
;; 110 - P2 changes x from 10 to 11 between the two times that P1 accesses the value of x during the evaluation of (* x x) .
;; 11 - P2 accesses x, then P1 sets x to 100, then P2 sets x .
;; 100 - P1 accesses x (twice), then P2 sets x to 11, then P 1 sets x .

</pre>
</dd>

<dt><u>Procedure:</u> <code>(test-and-set! cell)</code></dt>
<dd>
tests the cell and returns the result of the test. In addition, if the test was false, <code>test-and-set!</code>  sets the cell contents to true before returning false.<br>
The test-and-set! operation must be performed atomically . That is, the implementations must guarantee that, once a process has tested the cell and found it to be false, the cell con-
tents will actually be set to true before any other process can test the cell.

See Section 3.4.2, Subsection "Implementing Serializers".
</dd>
</dl>

The sample implementation uses <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-18/">SRFI-18</a>

<h3>Streams.</h3>

<dl>
<dt><u>Syntax:</u><code>(cons-stream a b)</code>
<dd>
Is equivalent to <code>(cons a (delay b))</code>.
See SICP Section 3.5.1.
<u>Remark:</u>
The necessity to include <code>cons-stream</code> is due to  the fact that SICP does not introduce any syntax-altering constructs beyond writing your own metacircular interpreter.
</dd>

<dt><u>Constant:</u><code>the-empty-stream</code></dt>
<dd>a distinguishable object, which cannot be the result of any <code>cons-stream</code> operation.
See SICP Section 3.5.1, footnote 54.
<br>
<u>Remark:</u>
The implementations are encouraged to implement <code>the-empty-stream</code> as an empty list.
</dd>

<dt><u>Procedure:</u> <code>(stream-null? x)</code></dt>
<dd>
returns the value of <code>true</code> if <code>x</code> is <code>the-empty-stream</code>, and the value of <code>false</code> otherwise.
See SICP Section 3.5.1, footnote 54.
<br>
<u>Example:</u><br>
<pre>
(stream-null? the-empty-stream)
;; => #t
(stream-null? (cons-stream 'a 'b))
;; => #f
</pre>
The implementations are encouraged to implement <code>stream-empty?</code> as an <code>null?</code>.

</dd>
</dl>

<p>
As mentioned in <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-41/srfi-41.html">SRFI-41</a>
, Philip Wadler, Walid Taha and David MacQueen describe such streams as odd because, regardless of their length, the parity of the number of constructors <code>(delay, cons, '())</code> in the stream is odd.</p>

<p>These streams are similar, but equivalent to the "even" streams of the aforementioned SRFI.</p>


<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

The sample implementation consists of three files attached to this document.
<a href="srfi-libs.scm">srfi-libs.scm</a>
provides the code that can be <code>load</code>'ed in a Scheme REPL.
<a href="srfi-libs.sld">srfi-libs.sld</a>
is an R7RS library that can be <code>import</code>'ed in an R7RS Scheme,
provided that SRFI-18, SRFI-27 are available.
<a href="srfi-libs-tests.scm">srfi-libs-tests.scm</a> contains a simple conformance test, and uses <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-78/">SRFI-78</a>.
